    <p>After 8 years of writing code in C++, you'd think it would take something extraordinary to convince me to transition to another language. It turns out, that 'something extraordinary' is <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>. Given my background in mathematics, computer science, and my interest in linguistics and category theory, the shift was not merely a whim. Let's dive into the compelling reasons that made me hang up my C++ hat in favor of Rust.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<h2 id="type-safety-ownership-semantics"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#type-safety-ownership-semantics" aria-label="Anchor link for: type-safety-ownership-semantics">Type Safety &amp; Ownership Semantics</a></h2>
<p>One of the first things that drew me to Rust was its promise of memory safety without sacrificing performance. C++ is powerful, no doubt, but its power comes at the cost of complexity. A single misuse of pointers can lead to memory leaks, undefined behavior, or catastrophic system failures. Given my background in mathematics, the elegance of Rust's ownership model intrigued me. It enforces the minimum number of rules to avoid data-races (and other classes of bugs) at compile-time.</p>
<p>From a computer scientist's perspective, the ownership model of Rust is a game-changer. You're forced to think more rigorously about how you allocate and deallocate resources, but without the mental overhead of constantly second-guessing your code for potential pitfalls. It's an elegant solution to an age-old problem.</p>
<h2 id="immutable-by-default"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#immutable-by-default" aria-label="Anchor link for: immutable-by-default">Immutable by Default</a></h2>
<p>This might sound simple, but it's revolutionary in a C like language. In Rust, all variables are immutable by default. This feature subtly encourages a more functional programming style, which results in cleaner and more predictable code.</p>
<h2 id="expressive-type-system"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#expressive-type-system" aria-label="Anchor link for: expressive-type-system">Expressive Type System</a></h2>
<p>Rust's type system is one of its standout features, a paradise for someone who enjoys the mathematical foundations of computer science like me. It includes algebraic data types, pattern matching, and generics, all of which allow you to write expressive, yet type-safe code. It's easier to reason about the correctness and constraints of your program with such robust type system at hand.</p>
<h2 id="fearless-concurrency"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#fearless-concurrency" aria-label="Anchor link for: fearless-concurrency">Fearless Concurrency</a></h2>
<p>As computing power plateaus, concurrency becomes increasingly important. Rust's language design includes primitives that enable &quot;fearless concurrency,&quot; allowing me to experiment without the typical headaches of race conditions and deadlocks.</p>
<h2 id="composition-over-inheritance"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#composition-over-inheritance" aria-label="Anchor link for: composition-over-inheritance">Composition Over Inheritance</a></h2>
<p>Having had a love-hate relationship with object-oriented programming, Rust's focus on composition over inheritance is a breath of fresh air. In Rust, the use of algebraic data types, traits, and modules promotes a more composable and modular codebase. This aligns well with principles from functional programming, where the focus is often on how smaller pieces can compose to create more complex structures.</p>
<h2 id="a-playground-for-functional-programming-sicp-and-category-theory"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#a-playground-for-functional-programming-sicp-and-category-theory" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-playground-for-functional-programming-sicp-and-category-theory">A Playground for Functional Programming, SICP, and Category Theory</a></h2>
<p>One of the most intriguing aspects of Rust for me is its suitability as a playground for advanced computer science and mathematical concepts. The language's affinity with functional programming makes it a natural fit for exploring ideas from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) and category theory. Being a mathematician and a computer scientist, it's like having a sandbox where I can merge these worlds together.</p>
<h2 id="community-and-ecosystem"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#community-and-ecosystem" aria-label="Anchor link for: community-and-ecosystem">Community and Ecosystem</a></h2>
<p>Even though it's a relatively young language, Rust has a rich and growing ecosystem. Given its modern toolchain and package manager, Cargo, setting up and managing projects is often a smooth sailâ€”a nice break from the complexities I often faced in C++.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Rust's compiler, affectionately named <code>rustc</code>. One of its standout features is its incredibly descriptive error messages. Gone are the days of cryptic, indecipherable errors that send you spiraling down a rabbit hole of Stack Overflow pages. The <code>rustc</code> compiler not only pinpoints the exact location of the error but often provides a detailed explanation and a suggested fix. These &quot;quality of life&quot; features dramatically reduce the cognitive overhead of programming. </p>
<p><em>EDIT (2023-01-12): Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/CJtvnepMVAU?si=_tDrjaY0prvhCVT0">No Boilerplate's video on rustc's errors</a></em></p>
<h2 id="future-proofing"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#future-proofing" aria-label="Anchor link for: future-proofing">Future-Proofing</a></h2>
<p>Lastly, Rust is a modern language, built with the learnings of many predecessors in mind. Rust's focus on performance, safety, and robustness makes me confident that investing time in learning it is a future-proof decision.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while my journey with C++ has been invaluable, the leap to Rust feels like the next logical step in my ongoing adventure in the world of programming. Its paradigms resonate with my interests in functional programming and type safety. Rust not only addresses many of the shortcomings that I've experienced with C++, but it also opens new doors for exploration and innovation. Cheers to a new chapter!</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
